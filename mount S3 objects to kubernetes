To mount Amazon S3 objects to Amazon EKS pods, you can use the Amazon S3 FUSE tool. Here's how you can do it:

1.Create an Amazon S3 bucket if you haven't already done so.

2.Create an Amazon S3 access policy that allows access to the S3 bucket. You can create a policy using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

3.Create an IAM role for your EKS worker nodes that allows access to the S3 bucket. The role should include the access policy that you created in the previous step.

4.Install the Amazon S3 FUSE tool on your EKS worker nodes.

5.Create a Kubernetes secret that contains your AWS access key ID and secret access key. You can create the secret using the following command:



kubectl create secret generic aws-credentials --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key


6.Create a Kubernetes Pod specification that includes a volume mount for the S3 bucket. Here's an example YAML file:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
      volumeMounts:
        - name: s3-volume
          mountPath: /mnt/s3
  volumes:
    - name: s3-volume
      flexVolume:
        driver: "s3fs/fuse"
        options:
          endpoint: "s3.amazonaws.com"
          bucket: "my-bucket"
          access-key-id-file: "/etc/aws-credentials/aws-access-key"
          secret-access-key-file: "/etc/aws-credentials/aws-secret-key"
  restartPolicy: Never


This YAML file creates a Pod with a single container that mounts the S3 bucket at /mnt/s3. The volume is mounted using the Amazon S3 FUSE driver, and the access key ID and secret access key are read from a Kubernetes secret named "aws-credentials". Make sure to replace "my-bucket" with the name of your S3 bucket.

7.Apply the Pod specification using the kubectl command:
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml


The Pod will start running and the container will be able to read and write files to the S3 bucket through the mounted volume.
